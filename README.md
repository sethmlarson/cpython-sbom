# Software Bill-of-Materials for CPython

Project for generating a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) for CPython
release artifacts like source tarballs and binary installers.

SBOMs that have been generated by this script are available in the `sboms/` directory.

> **NOTE**
> SBOM generation infrastructure has been created and merged into CPython. You can now view and download SBOM files for CPython release artifacts.
> This repository is no longer required now that development has concluded.

## Process

- Determine the minimum elements of an SBOM from recommendations by downstream consumers:
  - [NTIA Minimum Elements of an SBOM](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf)
    - Supplier Name
    - Component Name
    - Version of Component
    - Other Unique Identifiers
    - Dependency Relationship
    - Author of SBOM Data
    - Timestamp
  - [SPDX Minimum Elements](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-ntia-sbom-howto/) (How NTIA Minimum Elements maps to SPDX 2.3)
    - `PackageSupplier`
    - `PackageName`
    - `PackageVersion`
    - `DocumentNamespace`, `SPDXID`
    - `Relationship` (`CONTAINS`)
    - `Creator` (of the SBOM)
    - `Created`
  - Other mandatory SPDX 2.3 fields
    - `SPDXVersion`
    - `DataLicense`
    - `SPDXID` (for Document)
    - `DocumentName`
    - `PackageDownloadLocation`
    - `FilesAnalyzed`
    - `Relationship` (`SPDXRef-DOCUMENT` `DESCRIBES` primary package)

- Determine the recommended elements of an SBOM:
  - [NTIA Minimum Elements of an SBOM](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf)
    - Hash of component
    - Lifecycle Phase
    - Other Component Relationships
    - License information

- Find projects/files of interest that are bundled along with CPython source tarball:
  - `curl https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/Python-3.11.5.tgz -o Python-3.11.5.tgz`
  - `tar -xzvf Python-3.11.5.tgz`
  - `find . -regex '.*/\(README\|LICEN\[SC\]\|COPYING\|NOTICE\).*' >> files-of-interest.txt`
  - `grep 'license' -ilR . >> files-of-interest.txt`
  - `sort files-of-interest.txt | uniq -u`

- Categorize all the files of interest based on whether there is a component
  that's sourced differently than CPython. Take note of all of these occurrences.
  These are captured programmatically in `build-sbom.py`.
